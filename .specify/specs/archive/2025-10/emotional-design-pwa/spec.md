# Spec: Emotional Design & PWA Features

**Feature ID**: `emotional-design-pwa`
**Status**: Draft
**Priority**: P1 - HIGH (Phase 3.2 & 3.3 - Makes app "lovable")
**Created**: 2025-10-04
**Owner**: emotional-design-specialist + react-frontend-developer

---

## üéØ Vision & Goals

**Transform the Teacher Assistant from "functional" to "beloved"** by implementing Duolingo-level engagement through:
- **60fps micro-interactions** that make every touch feel alive
- **PWA capabilities** enabling offline learning and app-like installation
- **Emotional feedback loops** celebrating wins and maintaining habit streaks

**Success Metric**: Teachers say **"Wow, das f√ºhlt sich gut an!"** (Phase 3 goal from roadmap-redesign-2025.md)

---

## üìä Problem Statement

### Current State ‚ùå
- App is functional but feels "dead"
- No animation feedback on interactions
- No offline support (fails in poor connectivity)
- No installation capability (always requires browser)
- No celebration of achievements
- Generic UI without personality

### Research Insights ‚úÖ
**From successful PWAs:**
- Pinterest: 843% increase in signups through performance + offline
- Twitter Lite: 65% more engagement via micro-interactions
- Duolingo: Habit formation through streaks + celebrations
- Uber PWA: 50KB core bundle for 2G networks

**Key Findings:**
1. **Performance = Engagement**: Every 100ms delay = 1% drop in engagement
2. **Offline-First = Critical**: Students learn with spotty WiFi
3. **Micro-Interactions = Lovable**: Immediate feedback creates delight
4. **Streaks = Retention**: Loss aversion drives daily usage

## üé® Solution Overview

### Phase 3.2: Micro-Interactions & Animations
**Goal**: Make every interaction feel alive

**Components:**
1. **Button Feedback** (Framer Motion)
   - Tap scale to 0.95 (100ms)
   - Haptic feedback on touch (10ms vibration)
   - Color shift on hover/press

2. **Loading States** (React Loading Skeleton)
   - Skeleton screens (15-30% better perceived perf vs spinners)
   - Progressive reveal animations
   - Shimmer effect during load

3. **Success Celebrations** (Confetti + Motion)
   - Confetti on quiz completion
   - Bounce animations for achievements
   - Progress ring fills with Gemini Orange gradient

4. **Smooth Transitions** (Framer Motion LazyMotion)
   - Page transitions (fadeIn, slideUp)
   - Modal animations (scaleIn from center)
   - Card hover states (scale 1.05, shadow increase)

5. **Progress Visualization**
   - Streak counter with flame icon üî•
   - XP progress bars with gradient fills
   - Achievement badges with unlock animations

### Phase 3.3: PWA Implementation
**Goal**: Native-like experience with offline support

**Components:**
1. **Service Worker** (Vite PWA Plugin)
   - Cache static assets (Cache First strategy)
   - Lesson content (Network First with offline fallback)
   - Background sync for progress updates

2. **Offline Storage** (Dexie.js + IndexedDB)
   - Lesson data persistence
   - Student progress queue
   - Chat history cache

3. **Install Prompt** (BeforeInstallPrompt API)
   - Show after 2+ visits OR 30+ seconds engagement
   - Context-aware (after lesson completion)
   - 20-30% acceptance rate target

4. **App Manifest** (PWA manifest.json)
   - Standalone display mode
   - Gemini Orange theme color (#FB6542)
   - App shortcuts (Today's Lesson, Library, Chat)
   - Maskable icons for adaptive display

5. **Mobile Polish**
   - 44px minimum tap targets (WCAG 2.1 AA)
   - Safe area handling (iOS notches)
   - Pull-to-refresh (custom implementation)
   - Swipe gestures (@use-gesture/react)

## üí° User Stories

### Micro-Interactions (Phase 3.2)

**Story 1: Button Feedback**
```
AS A teacher using the app
WHEN I tap any button
THEN I see immediate visual feedback (scale 0.95) + feel haptic vibration
SO THAT every interaction feels responsive and alive
```

**Story 2: Loading Experience**
```
AS A teacher loading lesson content
WHEN I navigate to a new page
THEN I see skeleton placeholders showing content structure
SO THAT I understand what's loading and perceived wait time is reduced
```

**Story 3: Achievement Celebrations**
```
AS A teacher completing a tutorial or task
WHEN I finish successfully
THEN I see confetti animation + progress ring fills + success toast
SO THAT I feel rewarded and motivated to continue
```

**Story 4: Streak Tracking**
```
AS A teacher using the app daily
WHEN I return each day
THEN I see my streak counter increment with flame icon animation
SO THAT I'm motivated to maintain daily habits (loss aversion)
```

### PWA Features (Phase 3.3)

**Story 5: Offline Access**
```
AS A teacher in a classroom with poor WiFi
WHEN I lose internet connection
THEN I can still access cached lessons and continue working
SO THAT connectivity issues don't interrupt my workflow
```

**Story 6: App Installation**
```
AS A teacher who frequently uses the app
WHEN I've visited 2+ times or spent 30+ seconds
THEN I see a subtle install banner
SO THAT I can install the app to my home screen for quicker access
```

**Story 7: Background Sync**
```
AS A teacher creating content offline
WHEN I complete work and connectivity returns
THEN my changes automatically sync to the server
SO THAT I never lose progress due to network issues
```

**Story 8: Mobile-Native Feel**
```
AS A teacher on mobile
WHEN I use the app
THEN touch targets are large (44px), gestures work intuitively, and safe areas are respected
SO THAT the app feels native, not web-based
```
