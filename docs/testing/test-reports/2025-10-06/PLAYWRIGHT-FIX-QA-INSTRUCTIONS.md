# QA INSTRUCTIONS - Test Auth Fix Verification

**Date:** 2025-10-05
**Priority:** URGENT
**Status:** Ready for QA Testing

---

## What Was Fixed

The Playwright test authentication was not loading because `VITE_TEST_MODE` environment variable wasn't being injected into the browser.

**Fix:** Changed `playwright.config.ts` to use Vite's `--mode test` flag instead of manual env variables.

---

## Quick Verification (2 Minutes)

### Step 1: Run Test Auth Verification
```bash
cd teacher-assistant/frontend
npx playwright test e2e-tests/test-auth-verification.spec.ts --headed
```

### Step 2: What You Should See

**Browser should show:**
- ‚úÖ Home screen loads directly (NO login screen)
- ‚úÖ Browser console shows red warnings: "üö® TEST MODE ACTIVE üö®"
- ‚úÖ Test user email: `s.brill@eduhu.de`

**Test output should show:**
```
‚úÖ 5 passed tests
‚ùå 1 failed test (unrelated selector issue - can ignore)

Passing tests:
‚úì should display test mode warnings in console
‚úì should have test user authenticated
‚úì should bypass login screen
‚úì should have correct environment variables
‚úì should auto-authenticate test user
```

---

## What Changed

### File: playwright.config.ts
```diff
webServer: {
-  command: 'npm run dev',
+  command: 'npm run dev -- --mode test',
-  env: {
-    VITE_TEST_MODE: 'true',
-    // ... other env vars
-  }
}
```

**Why this works:**
- Vite's `--mode test` loads `.env.test` file automatically
- `.env.test` contains `VITE_TEST_MODE=true`
- Browser now receives the environment variable correctly

---

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Test auth verification passes (5 tests)
- [ ] Browser console shows test mode warnings
- [ ] Home screen loads without login screen
- [ ] Test user is authenticated automatically

---

## Expected Console Output

```
[BROWSER CONSOLE warning]: üö® TEST MODE ACTIVE üö®
[BROWSER CONSOLE warning]: Authentication is bypassed with test user: s.brill@eduhu.de
[BROWSER CONSOLE warning]: This should NEVER be enabled in production!
```

## If Verification Fails

### Problem: Login screen still appears

**Solution:**
```bash
# Kill all running servers
# Run fresh Playwright test
npx playwright test e2e-tests/test-auth-verification.spec.ts --headed
```

### Problem: No test mode warnings in console

**Check:**
1. Verify `.env.test` file exists in `teacher-assistant/frontend/`
2. Check file contains: `VITE_TEST_MODE=true`
3. Restart Playwright completely

### Problem: Tests timeout

**Solution:**
```bash
# Increase timeout temporarily
npx playwright test e2e-tests/test-auth-verification.spec.ts --timeout=120000
```

## Next Steps After Verification

Once you confirm the fix works:

1. ‚úÖ Mark this task as complete
2. ‚úÖ Proceed with original QA bug verification tasks:
   - BUG-017: Layout restoration verification
   - BUG-018: Agent confirmation spacing verification
   - Other pending bug tests

3. ‚úÖ All Playwright tests should now work without manual authentication
