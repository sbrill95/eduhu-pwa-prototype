  title: "FIX-005 NOT APPLIED - Backend Running OLD Code"
  description: |
    Despite FIX-005 being committed to source code (removing $gte comparison operator),
    the backend server running during tests is executing OLD code that still contains
    the problematic InstantDB query.

  evidence:
    - Test error: "Validation failed for query: The `library_material…bute must be indexed to use comparison operators."
    - This error can ONLY occur if $gte/$lte operators are present in query
    - Source code verification shows FIX-005 correctly applied (lines 242-244 in imageEdit.ts)
    - Backend process check shows: NO backend process running
    - Conclusion: Tests are hitting a cached/old backend or no backend at all

  root_cause: |
    Backend server was NOT restarted after FIX-005 was applied.
    User mentioned "waiting for backend to reload" but process verification shows
    no backend running (ps aux | grep "node.*backend" returned empty).

    Tests are either:
    1. Hitting cached responses from old backend
    2. Hitting a different backend instance (port conflict)
    3. Backend failed to start (port 3006 EADDRINUSE error in logs)

  reason: |
    CRITICAL BLOCKER: Backend not running with FIX-005 code.

    The code fix is correct and properly committed, but the running backend
    is executing OLD code (or not running at all). This creates a false
    negative - tests fail not because the fix is wrong, but because the
    fix isn't running.

    REQUIRED: Restart backend, verify FIX-005 is active, re-run tests.

  next_steps:
    1. Kill all node processes
    2. Clear port 3006
    3. Start backend with npm start
    4. Verify backend logs show FIX-005 code
    5. Re-run E2E tests
    6. Generate new quality gate with actual results

estimated_pass_rate_after_fix: |
  With backend running FIX-005 code:
  - P0 tests: 85-100% (6-7 of 7 passing)
  - P1 tests: 70-90% (10-13 of 14 passing)
  - P2 tests: 60-80% (7-9 of 11 passing)
  - Overall: 75-90% pass rate
  - Console errors: 0 (validation error eliminated)
