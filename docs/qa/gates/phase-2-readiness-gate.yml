# Quality Gate Decision
decision: CONCERNS
status: conditional_pass
risk_level: MEDIUM
confidence: HIGH

# Decision Summary
summary: |
  Phase 2 is partially complete with frontend production-ready but backend
  has critical build errors. Recent features (US5, US2) verified working.
  Epic 3.0 can begin after fixing P0 blockers (backend build + test infrastructure).

# Concerns (Non-Blocking)
concerns:
  - id: CONCERN-001
    title: Missing QA Directory Structure
    severity: P1
    type: process
    description: docs/qa/ directory does not exist, no quality gates
    impact: Manual QA workflow instead of BMad standard
    recommendation: Create docs/qa/assessments/ and docs/qa/gates/

  - id: CONCERN-002
    title: E2E Tests Blocked by Mock Environment
    severity: P1
    type: test_infrastructure
    description: Mock Service Worker can't load Ionic UI
    impact: Manual testing required for features
    recommendation: Fix MSW setup or accept manual testing workflow

  - id: CONCERN-003
    title: OpenAI Agents SDK Access Unverified
    severity: P0
    type: dependency
    description: Need to verify API key has Agents SDK access
    impact: Cannot start Epic 3.0 without SDK access
    recommendation: Check OpenAI dashboard before Story 3.0.1
