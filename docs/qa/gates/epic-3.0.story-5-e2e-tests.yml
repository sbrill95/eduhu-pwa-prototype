reviewer_notes: |
  Story 3.0.5 represents exceptional quality in E2E testing implementation. The dev team demonstrated:

  1. **Proactive Problem Solving**: Two critical issues (InstantDB mutations, TypeScript errors) were identified and fixed autonomously during implementation.

  2. **Zero Tolerance for Quality Issues**: ZERO console errors policy enforced across ALL tests - this is production-grade quality.

  3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: 18 E2E tests covering all 6 acceptance criteria with 100% traceability.

  4. **Excellent Documentation**: Session logs, test reports, and fix logs provide complete audit trail.

  5. **Performance Focus**: Benchmarks defined and validated (router <5s, E2E <15s).

  6. **Test Isolation**: Mock InstantDB client ensures tests don't depend on external DB state.

  This story is a model example of BMad methodology in action. APPROVED FOR PRODUCTION.

  PASS decision based on:
  - ‚úÖ All 6 acceptance criteria 100% covered
  - ‚úÖ 18 comprehensive E2E tests implemented and passing
  - ‚úÖ ZERO console errors (strict quality gate)
  - ‚úÖ Build clean (0 TypeScript errors)
  - ‚úÖ Performance benchmarks met
  - ‚úÖ No critical or high-severity issues
  - ‚úÖ Medium issues are future optimizations (not blockers)
  - ‚úÖ Excellent test quality (no flaky tests, proper async handling)
  - ‚úÖ Complete documentation (test report, session logs)
  - ‚úÖ Epic 3.0 100% complete (all 5 stories done)

  Minor issues (bundle size, test data structure) are LOW priority and documented for future improvement.
