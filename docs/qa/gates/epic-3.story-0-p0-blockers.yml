# Gate Decision
decision: FAIL
status: BLOCKED

# Summary
summary: |
  P0 blocker fixes attempted over 2+ hours across 2 sessions. While OpenAI SDK access is confirmed,
  backend has 203 TypeScript errors preventing deployment, and frontend test infrastructure is broken.
  The project is NOT READY for Epic 3.0 implementation.

# Recommendations
recommendations:
  immediate_actions:
    - "Fix backend type mismatches (grade_levels, TeachingPreference)"
    - "Fix InstantDBService.db() API calls throughout codebase"
    - "Add missing type exports (KnowledgeExtractionRequest, etc.)"
    - "Fix implicit 'any' types in lambda parameters"
    - "Separate Playwright tests from Vitest configuration"

  deferred_actions:
    - "Comprehensive type audit for consistency"
    - "Test infrastructure reorganization"
    - "Add regression tests for fixed areas"

  epic_3_readiness:
    recommendation: DELAY
    reason: "Building Epic 3.0 on broken foundation will multiply errors and waste time"
    estimated_delay: "1.5 days"
    next_steps:
      - "Complete P0 fixes (8-10 hours of focused work)"
      - "Run full validation suite"
      - "QA re-review and update gate to PASS"
      - "Then start Epic 3.0 with clean slate"

# Effort Estimation

# Decision Rationale
rationale: |
  This FAIL decision is based on:

  1. **Backend Non-Deployable**: 203 TypeScript errors prevent compilation and deployment.
     This is not a cosmetic issue - the code literally cannot be shipped.

  2. **Runtime Crash Risk**: InstantDBService API misuse in 15+ locations will cause
     immediate crashes when database operations are attempted. This is a production P0.

  3. **Data Integrity Risk**: Type mismatches between schema (string[]) and implementation
     (string) will corrupt data or cause runtime errors during seeding.

  4. **Test Infrastructure Broken**: Can't verify code quality because tests don't run
     properly. Backend tests blocked by build failure, frontend tests fail due to
     Playwright/Vitest conflicts.

  5. **Systemic Issues**: These are not isolated bugs but structural problems that need
     foundational fixes before building Epic 3.0 on top.

  The OpenAI SDK verification is complete and successful, but that's only 1 of 3 P0 blockers.
  The other two (backend build, frontend tests) remain critical blockers.

  Starting Epic 3.0 now would:
  - Build on a broken foundation
  - Multiply errors (new code + old errors)
  - Make debugging harder
  - Risk wasting Epic 3.0 implementation work

  Delaying 1.5 days to fix P0 blockers properly will save time and reduce risk in the long run.

# Quality Standards Compliance
compliance:
  code_quality:
    typescript_strict: FAIL # 203 violations
    type_safety: FAIL # 35+ implicit 'any'
    build_clean: FAIL # Backend fails
    linting: UNKNOWN # Can't run (build fails)

  testing:
    unit_tests: FAIL # Backend can't run
    integration_tests: PARTIAL # Some pass
    e2e_tests: FAIL # Infrastructure issue
    test_isolation: FAIL # Playwright leaks into Vitest

  documentation:
    session_log: PASS # Excellent
    type_definitions: FAIL # Inconsistent with schema
    test_documentation: FAIL # Missing rationale

# Lessons Learned
lessons_learned:
  what_went_well:
    - "Excellent session documentation and tracking"
    - "Systematic approach to fixes"
    - "OpenAI SDK verified early"

  what_went_wrong:
    - "Scope underestimation: 30 errors → 203 when all revealed"
    - "Symptom fixes attempted instead of root cause fixes"
    - "Type inconsistencies not caught during schema design"
    - "Test infrastructure not validated before use"

  improvements:
    - "Always run full build FIRST to get complete error count"
    - "Validate schema consistency before implementation"
    - "Separate test runners from the start (Playwright vs Vitest)"
    - "Type audit before major feature work"
