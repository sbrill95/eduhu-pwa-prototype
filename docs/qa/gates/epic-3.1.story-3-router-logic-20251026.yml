# Quality Gate Decision: CONCERNS (UNCHANGED from 2025-10-25)
# Rationale: Implementation complete, but application bugs prevent full E2E validation.
# Minor improvements in E2E pass rate, but BUG-002, BUG-003, BUG-004 still present.

conclusion: |
  Story 3.1.3 implementation remains COMPLETE and FUNCTIONAL with excellent code quality.
  E2E pass rate improved from 44% (2025-10-25) to 55% (2025-10-26), showing progress.

  However, three application bugs continue to prevent full E2E validation:
  - BUG-002 (Router Confidence): STILL BLOCKING manual override tests (AC3, AC5)
  - BUG-003 (Performance): STILL PRESENT, classification slower than 500ms target
  - BUG-004 (Console Errors): WORSENED from 4 to 5 errors

  BUG-001 (Chat Session Creation) appears resolved or non-blocking, as tests now pass
  without session errors. This should be investigated to confirm resolution.

  These issues are NON-BLOCKING for Story 3.1.3 completion but REQUIRE FIXES before
  production deployment.

  ESTIMATED TIME TO 100% E2E PASS RATE: 7-9 hours
  - BUG-002 fix: +22% (55% → 77%)
  - BUG-003 fix: +11% (77% → 88%)
  - BUG-004 fix: +12% (88% → 100%)

  RECOMMENDATION: Fix bugs in sequence (BUG-002 → BUG-003 → BUG-004), re-testing
  after each fix to validate improvement. Story 3.1.4 can start in parallel.
