fix_analysis:
  what_was_fixed:
    - "Removed invalid imports from ../schemas/instantdb"
    - "Defined UserUsage and AgentExecution interfaces locally in agentService.ts"
    - "Aliased GeneratedArtifact to Artifact type"
    - "Added proper TypeScript interface definitions"

  correctness: PARTIAL
  reason: "Fix allows server to RUN but build still FAILS with TypeScript errors"

  root_cause_addressed: NO
  explanation: >
    The fix is a WORKAROUND that defines types locally instead of addressing
    why these types are missing from the InstantDB schema. This creates type
    duplication and potential inconsistency.

  architectural_concerns:
    - "UserUsage and AgentExecution should likely be in instantdb schema"
    - "Local type definitions could diverge from actual database schema"
    - "GeneratedArtifact = Artifact alias is fine (consistent with schema)"

  concerns:
    - "Build command 'npm run build' FAILS but server runs via ts-node"
    - "Production deployment would fail (requires successful build)"
    - "TypeScript errors in test files affect test reliability"

    - issue: "No library materials appear after generation"

      expected: "Generated images should appear in library"
      actual: "STEP-9: Skipped - no library materials"

    - issue: "Regenerate button not accessible"

summary: >
  The backend fix successfully allows the server to START and RUN on port 3006,
  and the /api/agents-sdk/image/generate endpoint is OPERATIONAL. However, the
  fix is a WORKAROUND rather than a proper solution:

  POSITIVES:
  - Server runs and accepts requests
  - API endpoint works correctly
  - No runtime errors detected
  - Type definitions are explicit and clear

  CONCERNS:
  - Build command STILL FAILS (36 TypeScript errors)
  - Types defined locally instead of in schema (potential duplication)
  - Production deployment would fail due to build errors
  - E2E tests cannot verify full workflow (frontend not running)
  - Multiple UI issues remain (chat thumbnail, library filter, etc.)

  This is a FUNCTIONAL FIX but NOT a COMPLETE SOLUTION. The server works in
  development mode (ts-node) but would fail in production build.
