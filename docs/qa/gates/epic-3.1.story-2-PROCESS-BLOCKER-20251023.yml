  story_title: Image Editing Sub-Agent with Gemini
  decision: PROCESS_BLOCKER
  date: 2025-10-23
  reviewer: Quinn (BMad Test Architect)
  supersedes: epic-3.1.story-2-image-editing-20251022.yml

decision_explanation:
  category: PROCESS_BLOCKER
  reason: "Backend server not running with FIX-005 code. Test results invalid (backend version mismatch). Code quality EXCELLENT, deployment blocked by infrastructure issue."

  not_fail_because:
    - Code implementation COMPLETE and HIGH QUALITY
    - All 8 acceptance criteria met in source code
    - Security checks excellent (original preservation safety)
    - Error handling comprehensive across all layers
    - TypeScript types complete
    - Architecture solid and maintainable

  not_pass_because:
    - Cannot verify functionality without running backend
    - Test results invalid (ran against old backend version)
    - BMad standard requires verified functionality
    - Zero tolerance for unverified deployments

  blocker_type: INFRASTRUCTURE
  blocker_description: Port 3006 conflict preventing backend startup with latest code

    - "Clean TypeScript implementation with complete type coverage"
    - "Excellent error handling with user-friendly messages"
    - "Thoughtful UX: German UI, preset buttons, loading indicators"

  minor_issues:
    - "Unused scaffolding file (geminiEditService.ts) - AC4 image reference resolution"
    - "Performance benchmarks needed (awaiting valid test run)"
