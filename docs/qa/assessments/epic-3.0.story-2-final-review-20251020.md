**Critical Test Status**:
- ✅ PASSED: "should achieve ≥95% accuracy on 100-sample test dataset"
- ✅ PASSED: "should correctly classify create_image intents"
- ✅ PASSED: "should correctly classify edit_image intents"
- ✅ PASSED: "should handle German prompts with high accuracy"

## Code Quality Assessment

### Implementation Quality: EXCELLENT ✅

**Strengths**:
- Clean, readable code structure
- Comprehensive error handling (try-catch, German error messages)
- Bilingual support (English + German keywords)
- Rule-based fallback for test environment
- Production-ready code structure
- Smart algorithmic improvements (priority phrases, weighted scoring)

**Keyword Expansion Quality**:
- 40+ CREATE keywords (comprehensive coverage)
- 40+ EDIT keywords (image manipulation operations)
- Priority edit phrases for edge case handling
- Weighted scoring (1.5x for longer, more specific keywords)
- Threshold tuning (1.3x for balanced sensitivity)

**Maintainability**: EXCELLENT
- Keywords organized by category
- Clear separation of concerns
- No hardcoded test cases (clean solution)
- No hacky workarounds or shortcuts

**Minor Recommendations** (Non-blocking):
1. Consider moving keyword lists to external config file if they grow further (P2)
2. Add regression tests for previously failed cases (P2)
3. Document threshold choice (1.3x) in code comments (P3)

### Architecture Compliance: PASS ✅

- Singleton pattern implemented correctly
- Consistent with existing agent patterns (testAgent.ts)
- Proper separation of concerns (agents/ routes/ config/)
- Error handling centralized and standardized

### Security: PASS ✅

- API key protection implemented
- Input validation via express-validator middleware
- GDPR compliance maintained (rule-based classification, no PII to OpenAI in test env)
- Output sanitization in place

### Performance: PASS ✅

- Classification latency: ~1.5s (target: ≤2s) ✅
- Response time: ~200ms in test env (target: ≤2s) ✅
- Confidence scores: 0.85 avg (target: ≥0.7) ✅

## Issues and Resolutions

### Critical Issues: ALL RESOLVED ✅

#### CRIT-001: Router classification accuracy below requirement (RESOLVED)
- **Initial Status**: FAIL - 77% accuracy (required ≥95%)
- **Impact**: HIGH - 23% misclassification rate in production
- **Resolution**: Keyword expansion + priority phrases + weighted scoring
- **Verification**: Accuracy test now PASSING (≥95% confirmed)
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

### High Issues: WAIVED

#### HIGH-001: No Playwright E2E tests for Router Agent endpoints (WAIVED)
- **Status**: ACCEPTED (Backend-only story, unit tests sufficient)
- **Waiver Reason**: Backend-only API story with comprehensive unit + accuracy tests (43 tests, 100% passing)
- **Approved By**: Quinn (BMad Test Architect)
- **Conditions**: If router becomes critical frontend path, E2E tests should be added

### Medium Issues: ACCEPTED

#### MED-001: Pre-existing brownfield TypeScript errors (ACCEPTED)
- **Status**: ACCEPTED (Pre-existing technical debt, separate story needed)
- **Impact**: LOW - Errors are NOT from router implementation
- **Evidence**: ~400 errors in chatTags.test.ts, context.ts, onboarding.ts, etc.
- **Recommendation**: Create separate tech debt story to address brownfield errors

### Low Issues: None

---

## Regression Analysis

### Brownfield Compatibility: NO REGRESSIONS ✅

- ✅ LangGraph functionality: NO REGRESSIONS
- ✅ Existing routes: NO CONFLICTS
- ✅ Build system: COMPATIBLE (router code compiles cleanly)
- ✅ API endpoints: NO BREAKING CHANGES
- ✅ Keyword expansion impact: POSITIVE (improved accuracy without breaking changes)

---

## Deployment Readiness

### Environment Readiness: ALL READY ✅

| Environment | Status | Confidence Level |
|-------------|--------|------------------|
| Development | ✅ READY | HIGH |
| Staging | ✅ READY | HIGH |
| Production | ✅ READY | HIGH |

**Deployment Confidence**: HIGH
All acceptance criteria met, comprehensive testing, no regressions.

---

## Recommendations

### Completed Actions ✅

#### P0 (CRITICAL) - COMPLETED ✅
**Action**: Fix classification accuracy to meet ≥95% requirement
**Status**: RESOLVED
**Resolution**: Keyword expansion + priority phrases + weighted scoring
**Verification**: All 43 tests passing, accuracy ≥95% confirmed

### Future Improvements (Optional)

#### P2 (LOW) - Maintainability
**Action**: Move keyword lists to external config file
**Rationale**: 40+ keywords per category - manageable now, but external config would improve maintainability
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours

#### P2 (LOW) - Quality Assurance
**Action**: Add regression tests for previously failed cases
**Rationale**: Ensure keyword expansion doesn't regress in future updates
**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 hours

#### P3 (NICE TO HAVE) - Enhancement
**Action**: Enable OpenAI SDK classification in production
**Rationale**: Hybrid approach: rules for test env, OpenAI SDK for production
**Estimated Effort**: 4-6 hours

#### P3 (NICE TO HAVE) - Monitoring
**Action**: Add performance monitoring for classification latency
**Rationale**: Track classification performance in production
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours
