## Detailed Risk Analysis

### 1. Technical Risks

#### RISK-T1: Complex Modal UI Implementation
**Description**: Edit modal requires split-view (40% original, 60% edit), preview, preset buttons, and responsive design.

**Probability**: 2 (Medium) - UI complexity moderate but manageable
**Impact**: 2 (Medium) - Poor UI = bad UX, but fixable
**Risk Score**: **4 (MEDIUM)** ðŸŸ¡

**Mitigation**:
- Start with UI mockup/wireframe (get user approval early)
- Use Tailwind utilities for responsive layout
- Implement preview as separate component (testable)
- E2E tests for all modal states (open, preview, save, cancel)
- Screenshot validation for visual correctness

**Testing Strategy**:
- Visual regression tests (Playwright screenshots)
- Test all button states and transitions
- Mobile responsive testing (if applicable)
- Accessibility testing (keyboard navigation)

---

#### RISK-T2: German NLP Processing Accuracy
**Description**: System must understand diverse German instructions ("Ã¤ndere", "bearbeite", "fÃ¼ge hinzu", "entferne") with context ("das rote Auto", "im Vordergrund").

**Probability**: 3 (High) - Natural language is inherently ambiguous
**Impact**: 2 (Medium) - Wrong edits = user frustration, but user can retry
**Risk Score**: **6 (MEDIUM)** ðŸŸ¡

**Mitigation**:
- Leverage Gemini's German language capabilities (built-in)
- Create test dataset with 50+ diverse German instructions
- Implement clarification dialog when confidence < 70%
- Provide preset buttons for common operations (reduce free text)
- Show preview BEFORE saving (user can reject bad edits)
- Log failed/unclear instructions for analysis

**Testing Strategy**:
- Test dataset: 50 German instructions (varied complexity)
- Edge cases: Slang, typos, ambiguous phrasing
- Context tests: "das letzte Bild", "alle Personen"
- E2E tests with screenshot validation (did edit work?)
- User acceptance testing with real teachers

**Fallback Plan**:
- If NLP accuracy < 80%, add more preset buttons
- Consider guided form (dropdowns) instead of free text

---

#### RISK-T3: Image Reference Resolution Complexity
**Description**: System must resolve references like "das letzte Bild", "das Dinosaurier-Bild" and ask clarifying questions with mini-previews.

**Probability**: 2 (Medium) - Logic complexity moderate
**Impact**: 2 (Medium) - Wrong image selected = user must retry
**Risk Score**: **4 (MEDIUM)** ðŸŸ¡

**Mitigation**:
- Implement simple heuristics first (last image, image with keyword in prompt)
- Use InstantDB queries to fetch recent images (last 4)
- Always show mini-preview in clarification (user confirms visually)
- Allow direct selection from Library (bypass NLP)
- Log ambiguous cases for UX improvements

**Testing Strategy**:
- Test clear references: "das letzte Bild" (unambiguous)
- Test ambiguous: "das Bild" when 3+ exist
- Test keyword matching: "das Dinosaurier-Bild"
- Test clarification dialog flow (E2E)
- Test direct Library selection (bypass)

---
