## Detailed Risk Analysis

### 1. Technical Risks

#### RISK-T1: Test Flakiness Due to Async Router Operations
- **Probability:** 3 (High - async operations are notorious for flaky tests)
- **Impact:** 3 (High - unreliable tests block CI/CD)
- **Score:** 9 (HIGH RISK)
- **Description:** Router classification and agent routing involve multiple async operations that can lead to race conditions in tests
- **Mitigation:**
  - Implement robust wait strategies using `waitForSelector` and `waitForFunction`
  - Add retry logic with exponential backoff
  - Use deterministic test data
  - Implement request interception for predictable responses
  - Add test stability monitoring (track flaky test rate)

#### RISK-T2: Complex Test Infrastructure Dependencies
- **Probability:** 2 (Medium - multiple moving parts)
- **Impact:** 3 (High - blocks all testing if infrastructure fails)
- **Score:** 6 (MEDIUM RISK)
- **Description:** Tests depend on SDK setup, router implementation, dual-path configuration, and existing test framework
- **Mitigation:**
  - Create isolated test environment with mocked dependencies
  - Implement health checks before test runs
  - Use feature flags to test both paths independently
  - Document all infrastructure requirements clearly

#### RISK-T3: Screenshot Comparison Brittleness
- **Probability:** 2 (Medium - UI changes frequently)
- **Impact:** 1 (Low - visual regression only)
- **Score:** 2 (LOW RISK)
- **Description:** Screenshot-based validation can fail due to minor UI changes
- **Mitigation:**
  - Focus on structural assertions over pixel-perfect comparisons
  - Use element presence checks instead of visual diffs
  - Implement screenshot baseline update process

### 2. Performance Risks

#### RISK-P1: Test Execution Time Exceeding 5 Minutes
- **Probability:** 2 (Medium - comprehensive test suite)
- **Impact:** 2 (Medium - slows down development)
- **Score:** 4 (MEDIUM RISK)
- **Description:** With 100+ existing tests plus new router tests, total execution time may exceed target
- **Mitigation:**
  - Parallelize test execution across workers
  - Implement test sharding strategy
  - Create fast/slow test suites
  - Cache test data and fixtures
  - Monitor and optimize slowest tests

#### RISK-P2: Performance Regression Detection Accuracy
- **Probability:** 2 (Medium - environment variability)
- **Impact:** 3 (High - could miss performance issues)
- **Score:** 6 (MEDIUM RISK)
- **Description:** Performance benchmarks (â‰¤15s) may vary across environments making regression detection unreliable
- **Mitigation:**
  - Establish baseline per environment
  - Use relative performance metrics (% change)
  - Run performance tests in isolated environment
  - Implement statistical analysis (p95, p99)
  - Add performance budget alerts

### 3. Integration Risks

#### RISK-I1: Breaking Existing 100+ E2E Tests
- **Probability:** 3 (High - major architectural change)
- **Impact:** 3 (High - blocks all development)
- **Score:** 9 (HIGH RISK)
- **Description:** New router tests might interfere with existing test suite, causing cascade failures
- **Mitigation:**
  - Run new tests in isolation first
  - Implement gradual integration approach
  - Use separate test databases/environments
  - Add backward compatibility checks
  - Create test impact analysis before merging

#### RISK-I2: API Contract Mismatches
- **Probability:** 2 (Medium - new SDK integration)
- **Impact:** 2 (Medium - tests pass but production fails)
- **Score:** 4 (MEDIUM RISK)
- **Description:** Tests might not accurately reflect production API contracts between router and agents
- **Mitigation:**
  - Use contract testing (Pact/OpenAPI)
  - Validate against production API schemas
  - Implement request/response recording
  - Add integration smoke tests

### 4. Data Risks

#### RISK-D1: Test Data Bias
- **Probability:** 2 (Medium - limited test scenarios)
- **Impact:** 2 (Medium - missed edge cases)
- **Score:** 4 (MEDIUM RISK)
- **Description:** Test prompts might not represent real user inputs, leading to false confidence
- **Mitigation:**
  - Collect real user prompts (anonymized)
  - Use property-based testing for edge cases
  - Implement fuzzing for input validation
  - Regular test data review and updates
  - A/B test results against production

### 5. Regression Risks (Brownfield)

#### RISK-R1: LangGraph to SDK Migration Side Effects
- **Probability:** 3 (High - fundamental change)
- **Impact:** 3 (High - core functionality broken)
- **Score:** 9 (HIGH RISK)
- **Description:** Tests might pass individually but fail when both systems run in parallel (dual-path)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Test both paths extensively
  - Implement feature flag testing matrix
  - Add cross-system integration tests
  - Monitor production metrics during rollout
  - Maintain rollback tests

#### RISK-R2: Existing Test Assumptions Invalidated
- **Probability:** 2 (Medium - architectural change)
- **Impact:** 2 (Medium - false positives)
- **Score:** 4 (MEDIUM RISK)
- **Description:** Current tests might make assumptions about LangGraph that don't apply to SDK
- **Mitigation:**
  - Audit existing test assumptions
  - Create abstraction layer for tests
  - Document behavioral differences
  - Update test documentation

### 6. Security Risks

- **Description:** OpenAI API keys might leak through test logs or screenshots
- **Mitigation:**
  - Use test-specific API keys
  - Implement log sanitization
  - Mask sensitive data in screenshots
  - Regular security audit of test output

## Mitigation Priority Matrix

### Immediate Actions (Before Development)
1. **Setup isolated test environment** - Prevents interference with existing tests
2. **Define performance baselines** - Establishes clear success criteria
3. **Create test data strategy** - Ensures representative coverage
4. **Implement retry/wait utilities** - Reduces flakiness from start

### During Development
1. **Incremental test addition** - Test each component in isolation first
2. **Continuous monitoring** - Track test execution time and flakiness
3. **Regular integration checks** - Ensure compatibility with existing tests
4. **Performance profiling** - Identify bottlenecks early

### Post-Development
1. **Test stability period** - Run tests repeatedly to identify flaky tests
2. **Performance optimization** - Optimize slowest tests
3. **Documentation update** - Capture lessons learned
4. **Monitoring setup** - Track test metrics in CI/CD

---

## Recommendations

### Development Approach
1. **Start with isolated unit tests** for router logic before E2E
2. **Implement tests incrementally** - one acceptance criteria at a time
3. **Use test-driven development** - write tests as you implement router
4. **Maintain backward compatibility** - ensure existing tests still pass

### Testing Strategy
1. **Separate concerns** - router tests vs. agent tests vs. integration
2. **Mock external dependencies** - reduce flakiness and improve speed
3. **Use data-driven tests** - parameterize test cases
4. **Implement proper teardown** - prevent test pollution

### Quality Assurance
1. **Code review focus** on test reliability over coverage
2. **Benchmark against existing tests** for consistency
3. **Monitor test metrics** - execution time, flakiness, failures
4. **Regular test maintenance** - update as implementation evolves

### Overall Risk Assessment: MEDIUM-HIGH

The story has significant risks primarily around:
1. **Test reliability** in a complex async environment
2. **Integration complexity** with 100+ existing tests
