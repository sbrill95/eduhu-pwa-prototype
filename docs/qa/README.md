## üéØ QA Workflow (BMad Method)

### Before Implementation

```bash
# 1. Risk Assessment (for complex/risky stories)
/bmad.risk docs/stories/epic-X.story-Y.md

# Output: docs/qa/assessments/epic-X.story-Y-risk-YYYYMMDD.md
# Identifies: Technical risks, integration risks, regression risks
```

```bash
# 2. Test Design
/bmad.test-design docs/stories/epic-X.story-Y.md

# Output: docs/qa/assessments/epic-X.story-Y-test-design-YYYYMMDD.md
# Defines: Test scenarios, test levels, priorities, execution approach
```

### During Implementation

```bash
# 3. Requirements Tracing (mid-development)
/bmad.trace docs/stories/epic-X.story-Y.md

# Output: docs/qa/assessments/epic-X.story-Y-trace-YYYYMMDD.md
# Validates: Test coverage matches acceptance criteria
```

```bash
# 4. NFR Assessment
/bmad.nfr docs/stories/epic-X.story-Y.md

# Output: docs/qa/assessments/epic-X.story-Y-nfr-YYYYMMDD.md
# Checks: Performance, security, reliability, scalability
```

### After Implementation

```bash
# 5. Comprehensive Review (MANDATORY before deployment)
/bmad.review docs/stories/epic-X.story-Y.md

# Output:
# - docs/qa/assessments/epic-X.story-Y-review-YYYYMMDD.md
# - docs/qa/gates/epic-X.story-Y-{slug}.yml
#
# Validates:
# - All acceptance criteria met
# - All tests passing (100%)
# - Zero console errors
# - Build clean (0 TypeScript errors)
# - Quality Gate decision
```

```bash
# 6. Gate Update (if fixes applied)
/bmad.gate docs/stories/epic-X.story-Y.md

# Updates: Quality gate status after fixes
```

## üé≠ Meet Quinn: BMad Test Architect

**Role**: Independent quality validation specialist

**Responsibilities**:
- Create test strategies before development
- Assess risks for complex stories
- Conduct comprehensive code reviews
- Enforce zero-tolerance quality standards
- Generate quality gate decisions
- Validate all acceptance criteria

**Standards Enforced**:
- **ZERO tolerance for console errors**
- **100% P0 test coverage mandatory**
- **Screenshots required for all features**
- **Original preservation safety (image editing)**
- **Performance benchmarks validation**
- **Security verification**

**Quinn's Motto**:
> "If it's not tested, it doesn't work. If it has console errors, it's not done. If it fails acceptance criteria, it's not ready."

---

## üìä Assessment Types

### 1. Risk Assessment (`/bmad.risk`)

**When**: Before implementing complex/risky stories

**Identifies**:
- Technical risks (API integration, performance, complexity)
- Security risks (data exposure, authentication, authorization)
- Integration risks (breaking changes, dependencies)
- Regression risks (impact on existing features)

**Output**: Risk mitigation strategies and test focus areas

---

### 2. Test Design (`/bmad.test-design`)

**When**: Before writing any code

**Defines**:
- Test scenarios (happy path, error cases, edge cases)
- Test levels (unit, integration, E2E)
- Test priorities (P0, P1, P2)
- Execution approach (manual, automated, mixed)
- Success criteria

**Output**: Complete test strategy document

---

### 3. Requirements Tracing (`/bmad.trace`)

**When**: Mid-development or before QA review

**Validates**:
- Every acceptance criterion has tests
- Test coverage is comprehensive
- No missing test scenarios
- Tests actually validate requirements

**Output**: Traceability matrix (AC ‚Üí Tests)

---

### 4. NFR Assessment (`/bmad.nfr`)

**When**: During or after implementation

**Checks**:
- **Performance**: Response times, load times, throughput
- **Security**: Auth, authorization, input validation, data protection
- **Reliability**: Error handling, retry logic, graceful degradation
- **Usability**: UI/UX quality, accessibility, responsiveness
- **Maintainability**: Code quality, documentation, test quality
- **Scalability**: Can handle growth, resource usage

**Output**: NFR compliance report

---

### 5. Comprehensive Review (`/bmad.review`)

**When**: After implementation complete (MANDATORY)

**Comprehensive Analysis**:
1. **Code Review**
   - TypeScript type safety
   - Error handling completeness
   - Security checks
   - Performance optimizations

2. **Test Validation**
   - All tests passing
   - Test quality assessment
   - Coverage verification
   - Console error checking

3. **Requirements Verification**
   - All acceptance criteria met
   - No scope creep
   - Edge cases handled

4. **Documentation Check**
   - Session logs complete
   - Screenshots captured
   - README updates

5. **Quality Gate Decision**
   - PASS / CONCERNS / FAIL
   - Justification provided
   - Action items documented

**Output**:
- Comprehensive review document
- Quality gate YAML file

## üìù File Naming Conventions

### Assessment Files (Markdown)

```
Pattern: epic-{epic}.story-{story}-{type}-{YYYYMMDD}.md

Examples:
- epic-3.0.story-1-risk-20251017.md
- epic-3.0.story-1-test-design-20251017.md
- epic-3.0.story-1-review-20251020.md
- epic-3.1.story-2-trace-20251021.md
- epic-3.1.story-2-nfr-20251021.md
```

### Quality Gate Files (YAML)

```
Pattern: epic-{epic}.story-{story}-{slug}.yml

Examples:
- epic-3.0.story-1-openai-agents-sdk-setup.yml
- epic-3.0.story-2-router-agent.yml
- epic-3.1.story-2-image-editing.yml
```

**Exception**: Critical assessments may use `.md` for comprehensive detail:
```
epic-3.1.story-2-QUINN-CRITICAL-ASSESSMENT-20251023.md
```

---

## üîç Quality Standards (Non-Negotiable)

### Zero Tolerance Policies

1. **Console Errors**: ANY console error = Test FAIL
   - No exceptions
   - Even warnings should be investigated
   - Tests must scan for console output

2. **P0 Test Coverage**: 100% of P0 tests must pass
   - < 85% pass rate = FAIL quality gate
   - Flaky tests = FAIL (must be deterministic)

3. **Original Preservation** (Image Editing):
   - Original images MUST NEVER be overwritten
   - Explicit safety check required
   - Violation = CRITICAL FAIL

4. **TypeScript Errors**: Build must be clean
   - 0 compilation errors
   - 0 type errors
   - `any` types must be justified

5. **Screenshots**: Visual proof required
   - Minimum 3 per feature (BEFORE, AFTER, ERROR)
   - Full page screenshots
   - Saved to `docs/testing/screenshots/YYYY-MM-DD/`

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: When is QA review required?**
A: **ALWAYS**. Every story must have a comprehensive QA review before deployment.

**Q: Can I skip QA review for small changes?**
A: **NO**. Even small changes need validation. Quality standards are non-negotiable.

**Q: What if tests are flaky?**
A: **FIX THEM**. Flaky tests = FAIL quality gate. Tests must be deterministic.

**Q: Can I ignore console warnings (not errors)?**
A: Warnings should be investigated. Some warnings indicate potential errors.

**Q: What if I disagree with Quinn's assessment?**
A: Document your reasoning, discuss with team, but respect quality standards.

**Q: How do I request a quality gate update after fixes?**
A: Run `/bmad.gate docs/stories/epic-X.story-Y.md` and re-run tests.
