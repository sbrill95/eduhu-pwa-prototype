## Corrected Cost Model

### Per-User AI Costs (Realistic Usage)

```yaml
Active Teacher (20 sessions/month, 10 prompts/session):
  Router calls: 200 × $0.000135 = $0.027/month
  Specialist agents: 200 × $0.02 = $4.00/month
  Memory operations (file-based): $0.14/month

  TOTAL: $4.167/month per active user
  Revenue: 15€/month
  Cost Ratio: 27.8% (HIGH - need optimization!)

Casual Teacher (5 sessions/month, 5 prompts/session):
  Router calls: 25 × $0.000135 = $0.0034/month
  Specialist agents: 25 × $0.02 = $0.50/month
  Memory operations: $0.018/month

  TOTAL: $0.52/month per casual user
  Revenue: 15€/month
  Cost Ratio: 3.5% (EXCELLENT!)

Inactive Teacher (0 sessions):
  TOTAL: $0/month
  Cost Ratio: 0%
```

## Cost Optimization Strategies

### Problem: Active Users Cost 27.8% of Revenue

**This is too high!** Need to optimize.

### Optimization 1: Use gpt-4o-mini for Simple Agents

```yaml
Current (gpt-4o for everything):
  Specialist agent output: 1,500 tokens × $10/1M = $0.015

Optimized (gpt-4o-mini for simple content):
  Worksheet generation: 1,500 tokens × $0.60/1M = $0.0009
  Image suggestions: 500 tokens × $0.60/1M = $0.0003

Savings: ~90% for simple content agents
```

**Impact**:
```yaml
Before: $4.00/user/month
After: $0.80/user/month (80% reduction!)

Cost Ratio: 5.3% of revenue ✅
```

---

### Optimization 2: Prompt Caching (for Playbooks)

```yaml
Current: Every call loads full playbook context
  Playbook: 3,000 tokens × $2.50/1M = $0.0075 per call
  200 calls/month = $1.50/month waste

Optimized: Cache playbook context
  First call: 3,000 tokens × $3.125/1M (cache write) = $0.009375
  Next 199 calls: 3,000 × $0.25/1M (cache read) = $1.4925
  Total: $1.50 → $0.15/month

Savings: 90% on context loading
```

**Impact**:
```yaml
Before: $0.80/user/month
After: $0.20/user/month (75% reduction!)

Cost Ratio: 1.3% of revenue ✅✅
```

---

### Optimization 3: Batch Non-Urgent Operations

```yaml
Current: Memory updates after every session
  20 sessions × LLM summarization = 20 API calls

Optimized: Batch weekly summarization
  1 weekly batch × LLM = 1 API call

Savings: 95% on memory operations
```

**Impact**: Negligible (memory already <1% of cost), but good practice.

## Key Optimizations Explained

### 1. Model Selection Strategy

```typescript
// DON'T use gpt-4o for everything!
// Use model tier based on complexity

const MODEL_STRATEGY = {
  router: 'gpt-4o-mini',           // Simple intent detection
  worksheet: 'gpt-4o-mini',        // Structured content
  quiz: 'gpt-4o-mini',             // Q&A generation
  lessonPlan: 'gpt-4o',            // Complex pedagogical reasoning
  feedback: 'gpt-4o',              // Nuanced assessment
  image: 'gpt-4o'                  // Creative prompts need quality
};

// Cost impact:
// Before (all gpt-4o): $0.02/call
// After (mixed): $0.004/call (80% reduction!)
```

---

### 2. Prompt Caching for Static Context

```typescript
// Playbooks rarely change - cache them!

const CACHED_CONTEXT = {
  playbooks: {
    ttl: '1 hour',  // OpenAI cache TTL
    content: `
      # Bloom's Taxonomy Playbook
      [3,000 tokens of static curriculum guidance]
    `
  }
};

// Every API call:
const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: 'gpt-4o-mini',
  messages: [
    { role: 'system', content: CACHED_CONTEXT.playbooks.content }, // CACHED
    { role: 'user', content: userQuery } // Fresh
  ]
});

// Cost savings:
// Before: 3,000 tokens × $0.15/1M × 200 calls = $90/month
// After: 3,000 × $0.01875/1M × 200 = $11.25/month (88% reduction!)
```

---

### 3. Batch Non-Critical Updates

```typescript
// Don't update memory after EVERY session
// Batch updates hourly or daily

// BAD: Update immediately (200 LLM calls/month)
router.post('/api/session/end', async (req, res) => {
  await updateMemory(userId, session); // LLM call!
  res.sendStatus(200);
});

// GOOD: Queue for batch processing (5 LLM calls/month)
router.post('/api/session/end', async (req, res) => {
  await queue.add('memory-update', { userId, session });
  res.sendStatus(200);
});

// Background job (runs daily)
cron.schedule('0 2 * * *', async () => {
  const updates = await queue.getBatch('memory-update', 100);
  await batchUpdateMemory(updates); // Single LLM call for all!
});

// Savings: 95% reduction in LLM calls
```

---

### 4. Smart Context Selection (File-Based)

```typescript
// Don't load ALL episodes - use keyword matching first

async function getRelevantContext(userId, query) {
  const episodes = await listEpisodes(userId);

  // Fast path: Keyword match (FREE)
  const keywords = extractKeywords(query); // "7b", "Bruchrechnung"
  const fastMatches = episodes.filter(ep =>
    keywords.some(k => ep.title.includes(k) || ep.topic.includes(k))
  );

  if (fastMatches.length <= 3) {
    return fastMatches; // No LLM needed!
  }

  // Slow path: LLM ranking (only when needed)
  return await rankWithLLM(query, fastMatches);
}

// Impact: 70% of queries use fast path (FREE)
//         30% of queries need LLM ($0.0001)
```

---

## Final Cost Breakdown (Realistic)

### Assumptions (Conservative)

```yaml
User Distribution:
  40% active (20 sessions/month, 10 prompts/session)
  40% casual (5 sessions/month, 5 prompts/session)
  20% inactive (0 sessions)

Optimization Applied:
  ✅ gpt-4o-mini for simple agents (80% of calls)
  ✅ gpt-4o for complex agents (20% of calls)
  ✅ Prompt caching for playbooks
  ✅ Batch memory updates
  ✅ Keyword-based fast path (70% of context queries)
```

### File-Based Hybrid (Recommended)

```yaml
Per Active User:
  Router: 200 × $0.000135 = $0.027
  Simple agents (80%): 160 × $0.0004 = $0.064
  Complex agents (20%): 40 × $0.02 = $0.80
  Memory ops: $0.014
  TOTAL: $0.905/month

Per Casual User:
  Router: 25 × $0.000135 = $0.0034
  Simple agents: 20 × $0.0004 = $0.008
  Complex agents: 5 × $0.02 = $0.10
  Memory ops: $0.002
  TOTAL: $0.113/month

At 50 Users:
  20 active × $0.91 = $18.20
  20 casual × $0.11 = $2.26
  10 inactive × $0 = $0

  TOTAL: $20.46/month (~19€)
  Revenue: 750€
  Cost: 2.5% ✅✅
  Margin: 97.5%
```

### Claude Memory Tool (Alternative)

```yaml
Per Active User:
  Same orchestrator: $0.905
  Memory Tool reads: 20 sessions × $0.01 = $0.20
  Memory Tool writes: 2 updates × $0.003 = $0.006
  TOTAL: $1.111/month

Per Casual User:
  Orchestrator: $0.113
  Memory reads: 5 × $0.01 = $0.05
  Memory writes: 1 × $0.003 = $0.003
  TOTAL: $0.166/month

At 50 Users:
  20 active × $1.11 = $22.22
  20 casual × $0.17 = $3.32
  10 inactive × $0 = $0

  TOTAL: $25.54/month (~23€)
  Revenue: 750€
  Cost: 3.1% ✅
  Margin: 96.9%
```
