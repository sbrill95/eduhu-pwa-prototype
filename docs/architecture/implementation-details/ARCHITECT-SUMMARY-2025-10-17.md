## Technical Decisions Made

### Architecture Pattern: Event-Driven Navigation

**Decision**: Use CustomEvent for cross-component communication
**Rationale**:
- Proven pattern already working in codebase (BUG-030 fixes)
- No complex state management needed (no Redux/Zustand)
- Easy to test and debug
- Follows React best practices

**Implementation**:
```
AgentResultView → dispatches event with materialId
     ↓
Library → receives event, opens modal
     ↓
MaterialPreviewModal → displays content with accessibility
```

### State Management: React Context + Local State

**Decision**: Use existing AgentContext + component local state
**Rationale**:
- Feature doesn't need global state
- Keeps components loosely coupled
- Follows existing patterns in codebase
- Simple to maintain

### Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance

**Decision**: Full accessibility from day one, not as an afterthought
**Rationale**:
- Legal requirement in many jurisdictions
- Better UX for all users
- Easier to implement upfront than retrofit
- Demonstrates professional quality

**Implementation**:
- Keyboard navigation (Tab/Shift+Tab/Escape)
- Focus management (trap focus in modal)
- ARIA labels and roles
- Screen reader announcements
- Color contrast ≥4.5:1

### Testing Strategy: Comprehensive Multi-Layer

**Decision**: Unit + Integration + E2E + Manual verification
**Rationale**:
- Past issues: Tasks marked "complete" but UI broken (BUG-026, BUG-028, BUG-030)
- Visual features REQUIRE visual tests
- Definition of Done must be enforced
- Prevents regression

**Test Coverage**:
- Unit: Component behavior
- Integration: Cross-component flow
- E2E: Full user journey (Playwright)
- Manual: Real browsers/devices (Chrome, Safari, Mobile)
- Accessibility: Keyboard-only + screen reader

### Performance Requirements: Measurable

**Decision**: Concrete performance targets
**Rationale**:
- User experience depends on speed
- Measurable = verifiable
- Industry standards for "feels fast"

**Targets**:
- Navigation: <2s (from click to modal open)
- Modal open: <500ms (once data loaded)
- Animations: 60fps (smooth transitions)

**Mitigation**: Clearly documented in handoff with examples
**Status**: ✅ Mitigated

**Risk**: Field name mismatch (session vs session_id)
**Mitigation**: Documented in "Critical Gotchas" section
**Status**: ✅ Mitigated

**Risk**: Task marked complete without visual verification
**Mitigation**: Mandatory Definition of Done checklist
**Status**: ✅ Mitigated

### Medium Risks (Monitored)

**Risk**: Material not found in artifacts array (race condition)
**Mitigation**: Error handling with graceful degradation
**Status**: ⚠️ Monitored

**Risk**: Accessibility testing incomplete
**Mitigation**: Explicit testing steps in handoff
**Status**: ⚠️ Monitored

### Low Risks (Accepted)

**Risk**: Animation performance on low-end devices
**Mitigation**: CSS-based animations (hardware accelerated)
**Status**: 🟢 Accepted

**Risk**: Image load timeout on slow connections
**Mitigation**: Loading states + retry button
**Status**: 🟢 Accepted

## Implementation Complexity

### Effort Breakdown

**Total Estimated Effort**: ~8 hours

| Phase | Tasks | Effort | Complexity |
|-------|-------|--------|-----------|
| Core Navigation | T014-T016 | 1 hour | Low |
| UX Enhancements | Accessibility, Loading, Errors, Mobile | 2.5 hours | Medium |
| Testing | Unit + Integration + E2E | 2 hours | Medium |
| Documentation | Session log, commit | 30 minutes | Low |
| Buffer | Unexpected issues | 30 minutes | - |

### Complexity Assessment

**Low Complexity**:
- Event dispatch (proven pattern)
- Event handler (extends existing code)
- Loading states (standard React patterns)

**Medium Complexity**:
- Accessibility (requires knowledge of ARIA)
- Focus management (non-trivial edge cases)
- Mobile gestures (pinch-to-zoom)
- E2E tests (asynchronous timing)

**High Complexity**:
- None (all patterns are proven and documented)

---

## Code Quality Standards

### TypeScript Strict Mode

All code follows existing TypeScript strict mode:
- No implicit any
- Null checks required
- Proper type definitions

### Component Patterns

Following existing codebase patterns:
- Functional components with hooks
- Props interfaces defined
- React.FC type annotation
- Event handlers properly typed

### Styling

Following existing Tailwind patterns:
- Utility classes only
- Primary color: #fb6542
- Responsive modifiers (sm:, md:, lg:)
- Mobile-first approach

### Logging

**Current**: console.log everywhere (excessive)
**Recommended**: Transition to Winston
**For This Feature**: Keep console.log pattern for consistency, document cleanup needed

---

## Testing Philosophy

### Why Comprehensive Testing Matters

**Past Issues**:
- BUG-026: Visual feature passed unit tests but UI broken
- BUG-028: E2E test not run, modal invisible
- BUG-030: Navigation architecture misunderstood

**Root Cause**: Incomplete Definition of Done

**Solution**: Enforce mandatory testing checklist

### Test Pyramid for This Feature

```
       E2E Tests (1)
      /           \
 Integration (1)   Manual (4 devices)
    /         \
Unit Tests (3)  Accessibility (2)
```

**Bottom**: Fast, isolated, many
**Top**: Slow, integrated, few
**All Layers**: Required for DoD

## Final Notes

### What I'm Confident About

✅ Architecture pattern is proven (already working in codebase)
✅ All UX enhancements are industry best practices
✅ Testing strategy catches issues before production
✅ Definition of Done prevents past mistakes
✅ Developer agent has complete guidance

### What to Watch

⚠️ Accessibility testing requires manual verification (keyboard + screen reader)
⚠️ Performance testing requires real measurements (not just "feels fast")
⚠️ Mobile testing requires real devices (simulators aren't enough)

### If I Were to Implement This Myself

I would:
1. Start with T014-T016 (core navigation) - Get it working first
2. Add accessibility (UXE-001) - Easier to build in than retrofit
3. Add loading states (UXE-007-009) - Improve perceived performance
4. Add error handling (UXE-010-011) - Handle edge cases
5. Add mobile optimization (UXE-003-006) - Test on real devices
6. Write tests - Verify everything works
7. Manual verification - Test with keyboard + screen reader

This matches the task breakdown in the handoff document.

## Closing Thoughts

This feature is **ready for implementation**. The technical plan is comprehensive, the patterns are proven, and the testing strategy is thorough. The developer agent has everything needed to work autonomously and successfully.

The real value of this work isn't just solving US2 - it's establishing patterns for:
- Event-driven navigation (reusable for other features)
- Accessibility implementation (template for future modals)
- Comprehensive testing (prevents past mistakes)
- Definition of Done enforcement (ensures quality)

These patterns will make future features faster and more reliable.

**Status**: ✅ Ready for autonomous execution
**Risk Level**: 🟢 Low (all patterns proven)
