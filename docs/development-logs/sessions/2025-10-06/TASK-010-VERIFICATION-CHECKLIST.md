# TASK-010: "Neu generieren" Button - Verification Checklist

## Manual Testing Checklist

### Test 1: Button Visibility

- [ ] **✓ CHECK**: Button has refresh icon (🔄) on the left
- [ ] **✓ CHECK**: Button text reads "Neu generieren"

### Test 2: Button NOT Visible for Uploads
- [ ] Upload an image to the library (if supported)
- [ ] Click on the uploaded image
- [ ] Verify preview modal opens
- [ ] **✓ CHECK**: "Neu generieren" button does NOT appear
- [ ] **✓ CHECK**: Only Download, Favorite, Share, Delete buttons appear

### Test 3: Regenerate Flow - Same Parameters
- [ ] Generate an image with specific parameters (e.g., "A colorful classroom" + "realistic" style)

### Test 4: Regenerate Flow - Modified Parameters
- [ ] Generate an image
- [ ] Open preview modal
- [ ] Click "Neu generieren"
- [ ] Agent form opens with pre-filled data
- [ ] Change description to something different
- [ ] Change image style to different option
- [ ] Click "Generieren starten"
- [ ] **✓ CHECK**: New image is generated with modified parameters

### Test 5: Fallback Handling - Missing Metadata
This requires backend testing or mock data manipulation:
- [ ] Create a material object with missing `prompt` field
- [ ] Open preview modal
- [ ] Click "Neu generieren"
- [ ] **✓ CHECK**: Form pre-fills with `description` field as fallback
- [ ] **✓ CHECK**: No errors or crashes occur

### Test 6: Mobile Responsiveness
- [ ] Open browser dev tools
- [ ] Switch to mobile viewport (e.g., iPhone 12)
- [ ] Generate an image
- [ ] Open preview modal
- [ ] **✓ CHECK**: "Neu generieren" button is full-width
- [ ] **✓ CHECK**: Button is easily tappable (not too small)
- [ ] **✓ CHECK**: Button fits properly in modal layout
- [ ] Click regenerate button
- [ ] **✓ CHECK**: Agent form opens and works on mobile

### Test 7: Integration with Library
- [ ] Go to Library tab
- [ ] Find a generated image in the library
- [ ] Click on it to open preview modal
- [ ] **✓ CHECK**: "Neu generieren" button appears
- [ ] Click regenerate button
- [ ] **✓ CHECK**: Agent form opens with correct prefill
- [ ] Generate new image
- [ ] **✓ CHECK**: New image appears in library

### Test 8: Console Logging
- [ ] Open browser console
- [ ] Generate an image
- [ ] Open preview modal
- [ ] Click "Neu generieren"
- [ ] **✓ CHECK**: Console shows: `[MaterialPreviewModal] Regenerating image with params: {...}`
- [ ] **✓ CHECK**: Log includes `description` and `imageStyle` fields

## Automated Testing Verification

### Run Unit Tests
```bash
cd teacher-assistant/frontend
npm test -- MaterialPreviewModal.test.tsx --run
```

**Expected Output**:
```
✓ MaterialPreviewModal > should render material data correctly
✓ MaterialPreviewModal > should allow editing the title
✓ MaterialPreviewModal > should show delete confirmation alert
✓ MaterialPreviewModal > should render download button
✓ MaterialPreviewModal > TASK-010: Regenerate Button > should show regenerate button for agent-generated images
✓ MaterialPreviewModal > TASK-010: Regenerate Button > should NOT show regenerate button for uploaded images
✓ MaterialPreviewModal > TASK-010: Regenerate Button > should NOT show regenerate button for manual materials
✓ MaterialPreviewModal > TASK-010: Regenerate Button > should call openModal with correct prefill data
✓ MaterialPreviewModal > TASK-010: Regenerate Button > should handle missing image_style gracefully
✓ MaterialPreviewModal > TASK-010: Regenerate Button > should use fallback values when prompt is missing
✓ MaterialPreviewModal > TASK-010: Regenerate Button > should fallback to title when both prompt and description are missing
