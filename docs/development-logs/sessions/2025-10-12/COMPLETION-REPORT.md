## Known Issues & Recommendations

### Non-Blocking Issues

1. **E2E Test Timeout** (US2 Second Generation)
   - Expected behavior for real API integration test
   - All functionality verified before timeout
   - Recommendation: Increase Playwright timeout to 300s for multi-generation tests

2. **Bundle Size Warning**
   - Main chunk: 1,059.96 kB (>500 kB warning)
   - Production performance acceptable
   - Recommendation: Investigate code splitting for future optimization

3. **Visual Verification Pending** (US3, US4, US5)
   - Design improvements code-verified
   - Screenshots pending (optional, nice-to-have)
   - Recommendation: Capture in staging environment

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
1. Automated multi-agent workflow completed all phases efficiently
2. E2E tests caught critical issues early
3. Performance exceeded all targets significantly
4. Documentation was thorough and comprehensive
5. Pre-commit hooks prevented issues before commit

### What Could Be Improved
1. Visual verification could be automated with screenshot comparison
2. E2E test timeout configuration could be more flexible
3. Bundle size optimization should be addressed proactively
4. Real device testing should be part of automated workflow

### Best Practices to Continue
1. Always use SpecKit for structured implementation
2. Write E2E tests with real API calls (no bypass mode)
3. Document each phase thoroughly
4. Verify Definition of Done before marking tasks complete
5. Use pre-commit hooks to maintain code quality
