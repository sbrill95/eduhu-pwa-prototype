## Questions & Decisions

### Open Questions

1. **DALL-E Migration Strategy**:
   - Q: Should we maintain dual-path (LangGraph + SDK) or hard cutover?
   - Decision Needed: Before starting 3.0.3
   - Owner: Product Owner

2. **E2E Test Coverage**:
   - Q: What's the minimum E2E test coverage for production?
   - Decision Needed: Before completing 3.0.5
   - Owner: QA (Quinn)

3. **Gemini Integration Priority**:
   - Q: Start Epic 3.1 (Gemini) or Epic 3.2 (Admin) first?
   - Decision Needed: After Epic 3.0 complete
   - Owner: Product Owner

### Decisions Made

1. ✅ **TypeScript Compilation**: Fix all errors before new features (TD-1 complete)
2. ✅ **Router Accuracy**: Require ≥95% accuracy (Story 3.0.2 met requirement)
3. ✅ **Test Mode**: Use VITE_TEST_MODE=true to avoid API costs during E2E testing
4. ✅ **GDPR Compliance**: Tracing disabled by default, PII sanitization implemented
