## ðŸ”´ CRITICAL PRODUCTION BLOCKER

### Story TD-1: Fix All TypeScript Compilation Errors
**Status**: Ready for Development
**Priority**: P0 CRITICAL
**File**: [tech-debt.story-1.md](./tech-debt.story-1.md)

**Blocks**: ALL production deployments, Epic 3.2 (Production), Vercel deployment

**Quick Summary**:
- Backend build fails with 36 TypeScript errors
- Production deployment to Vercel is BLOCKED
- Must be completed BEFORE any production release
- Estimated: 4-6 hours development + 1-2 hours QA

**Why P0**: Cannot deploy to production with failing build. Every new feature adds more type errors.

## Overview

This directory contains **user stories** created from epics. Each story represents a single, implementable unit of work.

Stories follow the BMad story format with:
- User story description (As a... I want... so that...)
- Acceptance criteria
- Technical approach
- Implementation tasks
- Definition of done
- QA results (after review)

## Story Naming Convention

Stories are named using the pattern: `epic-X.Y.story-Z.md` or `tech-debt.story-Z.md`

Examples:
- `epic-3.0.story-1.md` - Story 1 from Epic 3.0
- `epic-3.0.story-2.md` - Story 2 from Epic 3.0
- `tech-debt.story-1.md` - Technical Debt Story 1
