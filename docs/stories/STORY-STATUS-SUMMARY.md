## Current Focus

### 🎯 Priority 1: Story 3.0.4 - Complete Phase 3 E2E Testing

**Why Priority 1**:
- Only story IN PROGRESS (finish what's started)
- Blocking 3 other stories (3.0.3, 3.0.5, Epic 3.0)

- Clear blocker: E2E test selectors need SDK agent update

**Tasks Remaining**:
1. Update E2E test for SDK agent (not LangGraph agent)
2. Verify router routes to SDK agent correctly
3. Complete 10-step workflow validation
4. Capture full screenshot set (BEFORE, AFTER, ERROR)
5. Request QA review

**Estimated Time**: 1 session (4-6 hours)
