**Performance & Monitoring:**
- Structured logging enables better production monitoring
- Request/response timing logged for performance analysis
- Error categorization and context for easier debugging
- Log rotation and file size management for production environments

**Next Steps for Production:**
- Configure log aggregation service (ELK stack, CloudWatch, etc.)
- Set up log-based monitoring and alerting
- Consider adding request correlation IDs for distributed tracing
- Implement log sampling for high-traffic scenarios

### Key Decisions
- **Winston over other logging libraries:** Chosen for mature ecosystem, extensive transport options, and production reliability
- **ESLint over TSLint:** ESLint is the modern standard with better TypeScript integration
- **Prettier integration:** Prevents code style debates and ensures consistent formatting
- **Structured logging:** Enables better monitoring, debugging, and log analysis in production
- **Strict type checking:** Eliminates runtime errors and improves code maintainability

### Code Changes
- Eliminated all 'any' types (4 instances found and replaced)
- Replaced 15+ console.log/console.error calls with structured logging
- Added comprehensive ESLint rules enforcing TypeScript best practices
- Implemented professional logging infrastructure with Winston
- Enhanced error handling with proper type safety throughout

### Learning Notes
- Modern ESLint v9 requires flat config by default, used legacy .eslintrc.json with environment flag
- Winston provides comprehensive logging solution out of the box with TypeScript support
- Structured logging with metadata significantly improves debugging capabilities
- TypeScript strict mode catches many potential runtime errors at compile time
- Quality automation (lint, format, type-check) essential for team development
