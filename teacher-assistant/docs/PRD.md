Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Project: Teacher Assistant
1. Overview
Vision Statement:
A conversational AI assistant specifically designed for educators that combines intelligent chat capabilities with persistent memory and specialized agents. The platform helps teachers with administrative tasks, lesson planning, research, and educational content creation through an intuitive chat interface.
Product Description:
Teacher Assistant is a Progressive Web App (PWA) that provides teachers with an AI-powered workspace featuring GPT-4 Vision integration, long-term memory management via Langgraph, and specialized agents for tasks like web research. The application maintains context across sessions and organizes past conversations and generated artifacts in an accessible library.
2. Objectives
Primary Goals:

Reduce administrative burden on teachers by 30-40% through AI assistance
Provide persistent, contextual AI conversations that remember teacher preferences and past discussions
Enable efficient research and content creation through specialized AI agents
Create a privacy-focused solution suitable for educational environments
Deliver a responsive, mobile-first experience for busy educators

Secondary Goals:

Build extensible agent framework for future educational tools
Establish foundation for school-wide AI assistant deployment
Create reusable patterns for AI-powered educational technology
