# Test Authentication Bypass - User Guide

## Overview

The test authentication system allows Playwright tests to run without requiring manual magic link authentication. This is achieved by bypassing InstantDB authentication when `VITE_TEST_MODE=true` is set.

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL SECURITY WARNING:** Test mode should **NEVER** be enabled in production environments. It bypasses all authentication security.

---

## Architecture

### Components

1. **Test Auth Module** (`src/lib/test-auth.ts`)
   - Defines test user mock data
   - Provides test auth state creator
   - Exports test auth methods (signOut, sendMagicCode, etc.)
   - Contains test mode detection logic

2. **Auth Context** (`src/lib/auth-context.tsx`)
   - Modified to check `VITE_TEST_MODE` flag
   - Conditionally uses test auth or real InstantDB auth
   - Displays console warnings when test mode is active

3. **Environment Configuration**
   - `.env.development` - Test mode disabled (production-like)
   - `.env.test` - Test mode enabled (for Playwright)
   - `playwright.config.ts` - Test mode environment variables

---

## Test User

**Email:** `s.brill@eduhu.de`
**User ID:** `test-user-playwright-id-12345`
**Type:** Mock user (no real backend authentication)

---

## Usage for QA/Testing

### Running Playwright Tests

Playwright tests are **automatically configured** to use test mode. Simply run:

```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd teacher-assistant/frontend

# Run all Playwright tests
npx playwright test

# Run tests in headed mode (see browser)
npx playwright test --headed

# Run specific test file
npx playwright test e2e-tests/your-test.spec.ts
```

The `playwright.config.ts` automatically sets:
- `VITE_TEST_MODE=true`
- `VITE_INSTANTDB_APP_ID=39f14e13-9afb-4222-be45-3d2c231be3a1`

### Manual Testing with Test Mode

If you need to manually test with test auth bypass:

1. **Temporary Environment Variable** (Session only)
   ```bash
   # Windows (PowerShell)
   $env:VITE_TEST_MODE="true"
   npm run dev

   # Windows (CMD)
   set VITE_TEST_MODE=true
   npm run dev

   # Linux/Mac
   VITE_TEST_MODE=true npm run dev
   ```

2. **Create `.env.local`** (Not recommended - easy to forget)
   ```bash
   # Create .env.local
   echo "VITE_TEST_MODE=true" > .env.local

   # Start dev server
   npm run dev

   # IMPORTANT: Delete .env.local when done!
   rm .env.local
   ```

3. **Check Console for Warnings**

   When test mode is active, you'll see:
   ```
   üö® TEST MODE ACTIVE üö®
   Authentication is bypassed with test user: s.brill@eduhu.de
   This should NEVER be enabled in production!
   ```

## Verification Checklist

### ‚úÖ Test Mode is Working If:

1. **Console shows warning banners** (red background)
2. **App loads without login screen**
3. **User is automatically authenticated as `s.brill@eduhu.de`**
4. **No magic link emails are sent**
5. **Auth methods are mocked** (check console logs)

### ‚ùå Test Mode is NOT Working If:

1. **Login screen appears**
2. **No console warnings about test mode**
3. **Authentication errors occur**
4. **App requires magic link**

### Troubleshooting

**Problem:** Login screen still appears
**Solution:**
- Check `VITE_TEST_MODE` is set to `"true"` (string, not boolean)
- Restart dev server after changing environment variables
- Clear browser cache and localStorage
- Check browser console for errors

**Problem:** Console shows no warnings
**Solution:**
- Verify environment variable is actually set: `console.log(import.meta.env.VITE_TEST_MODE)`
- Ensure you restarted the dev server after setting the variable

**Problem:** Tests fail with auth errors
**Solution:**
- Check `playwright.config.ts` has `VITE_TEST_MODE: 'true'` in webServer.env
- Ensure dev server is started by Playwright (not reusing existing server with wrong config)
- Set `reuseExistingServer: false` temporarily in playwright.config.ts

## Code Examples

### Writing Playwright Tests with Test Auth

```typescript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('user is automatically authenticated in test mode', async ({ page }) => {
  // Navigate to app - no login required!
  await page.goto('/');

  // Verify user is logged in
  // (Adjust selectors based on your app's UI)
  await expect(page).not.toContainText('Login');

  // App should be fully loaded
  await expect(page).toContainText('Home');
});

test('can access protected routes', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/');

  // Navigate to a protected route
  await page.click('text=Profile');

  // Should not redirect to login
  await expect(page).toHaveURL(/.*profile/);
});
```

### Checking Test Mode in Browser Console

```javascript
// Open browser console and run:
console.log('Test Mode:', import.meta.env.VITE_TEST_MODE);
console.log('User:', window.localStorage.getItem('instantdb-test-auth'));
```

## Security Best Practices

### ‚úÖ DO:

- Use test mode **ONLY** for local testing and CI/CD pipelines
- Set `VITE_TEST_MODE=false` in `.env.development`
- Never commit `.env.local` with test mode enabled
- Verify production builds have test mode disabled
- Review environment variables before deployment

### ‚ùå DON'T:

- Enable test mode in production
- Commit `.env.local` to git
- Share test mode credentials
- Assume test mode is secure
- Use test user data for real operations

## Environment Variable Reference

| Variable | Development | Test | Production |
|----------|-------------|------|------------|
| `VITE_TEST_MODE` | `false` | `true` | `false` |
| `VITE_INSTANTDB_APP_ID` | Real ID | Real ID | Real ID |
| `VITE_NODE_ENV` | `development` | `test` | `production` |

## FAQ

**Q: Can I use a different test user?**
A: Yes, modify `TEST_USER` in `src/lib/test-auth.ts`

**Q: Does test mode work with InstantDB queries?**
A: Yes, the test user ID is valid for database queries. However, data isolation is your responsibility.

**Q: What happens to InstantDB auth hooks in test mode?**
A: They are completely bypassed. The `db.useAuth()` call still happens but its result is ignored.

**Q: Can I test the login flow itself?**
A: No, not with test mode enabled. You'll need to disable test mode (`VITE_TEST_MODE=false`) to test actual authentication.

**Q: How do I test sign-out functionality?**
A: The test auth methods are mocked but log to console. Check console output to verify the method was called.

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Run Playwright tests to verify bypass works
2. ‚úÖ Check console for test mode warnings
3. ‚úÖ Verify app loads without login
4. ‚úÖ Test protected routes are accessible
5. ‚úÖ Ensure production build has test mode disabled
