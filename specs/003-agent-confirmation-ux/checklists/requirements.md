# Specification Quality Checklist: Agent Confirmation UX Fixes und Automatisches Bildtagging

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-14
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
  - **Status**: PASS - Spec focuses on user needs and behaviors, not implementation
  - **Evidence**: User stories describe outcomes, not technical solutions

- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
  - **Status**: PASS - All user stories have clear "Warum P1/P2" sections explaining value
  - **Evidence**: US1-US3 marked as MVP, US4-US6 as enhancements

- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
  - **Status**: PASS - Language is accessible, uses German for clarity with target audience
  - **Evidence**: "Als Lehrkraft möchte ich..." format throughout

- [x] All mandatory sections completed
  - **Status**: PASS - User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria all present
  - **Evidence**: All template sections filled with relevant content

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
  - **Status**: PASS - Zero clarification markers in spec
  - **Evidence**: All requirements are concrete and specific

- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
  - **Status**: PASS - All FR-xxx requirements use MUSS/DARF NICHT language with clear criteria
  - **Evidence**: FR-001 to FR-035 all have specific, verifiable conditions

- [x] Success criteria are measurable
  - **Status**: PASS - SC-001 to SC-010 include specific percentages and metrics
  - **Evidence**: "100% der Fälle", "≥90%", "7-10 Tags", "≥80% Precision"

- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
  - **Status**: PASS - Criteria focus on user-observable outcomes
  - **Evidence**: No mention of React, InstantDB, etc. in Success Criteria section

- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
  - **Status**: PASS - Each user story has Given/When/Then scenarios
  - **Evidence**: 3+ scenarios per user story (US1-US6)

- [x] Edge cases are identified
  - **Status**: PASS - 8 edge cases documented
  - **Evidence**: Vision API timeout, errors, duplicates, mobile scroll, etc.

- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
  - **Status**: PASS - "Out of Scope" section lists explicit exclusions
  - **Evidence**: Tag editing, multi-language, batch tagging all excluded

- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified
  - **Status**: PASS - Both sections present with specific items
  - **Evidence**: ChatGPT Vision API, InstantDB Storage, Tailwind config listed

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
  - **Status**: PASS - FR-001 to FR-035 map to user story acceptance scenarios
  - **Evidence**: Each FR uses "MUSS" with specific conditions

- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
  - **Status**: PASS - 6 user stories with independent tests
  - **Evidence**: US1-US3 cover MVP (visibility, navigation, chat integration)

- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
  - **Status**: PASS - SC-001 to SC-010 directly validate user stories
  - **Evidence**: Each SC maps to specific user story (SC-001→US1, SC-002→US2, etc.)

- [x] No implementation details leak into specification
  - **Status**: PASS - Spec remains technology-agnostic
  - **Evidence**: Focus on "what" not "how"

## Validation Summary

**Overall Status**: ✅ **PASS** - Specification is complete and ready for planning

**Items Passed**: 16/16 (100%)
**Items Failed**: 0/16 (0%)
**Clarifications Needed**: 0 markers

## Notes

- Specification is comprehensive with 6 user stories prioritized P1-P2
- All 35 functional requirements are concrete and testable
- Success criteria include both quantitative (100%, ≥90%) and qualitative measures
- Edge cases well-documented (8 scenarios)
- Clear boundaries with "Out of Scope" section
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements are specific

**Recommendation**: ✅ **PROCEED TO PLANNING** - Spec is complete and high-quality. Ready for `/speckit.plan` to create technical design.
