# Tasks: Library UX Fixes

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-library-ux-fixes/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (complete), spec.md (complete with 5 user stories)

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

**Tests**: E2E tests included per user feedback - MANDATORY to use real interactions (NO bypass mode)

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Web app structure**: `teacher-assistant/frontend/src/`, `teacher-assistant/frontend/e2e-tests/`
- All paths shown below are absolute from repository root

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Create shared utilities needed by multiple user stories

- [ ] T001 [P] Create type mapper utility in `teacher-assistant/frontend/src/lib/materialMappers.ts`
  - Export `ArtifactItem` interface
  - Export `UnifiedMaterial` interface
  - Export `convertArtifactToUnifiedMaterial()` function
  - Handle metadata parsing for image URLs
  - Support backward compatibility with old metadata structure

**Checkpoint**: Type mapper utility ready - can be used by User Stories 1-2

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: No foundational tasks needed - all dependencies already exist

**‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE**: MaterialPreviewModal, AgentContext, useLibraryMaterials hook, and InstantDB schema already exist and are functional. We can proceed directly to user story implementation.

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - View Generated Image in Library (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Teachers can click on image thumbnails in the Library to view full-size preview modal with metadata

**Independent Test**: Teacher generates an image, navigates to Library ‚Üí Bilder tab, clicks on thumbnail ‚Üí Full preview modal opens showing the complete image with all details.

### E2E Test for User Story 1 ‚úÖ MANDATORY

**NOTE: Write test FIRST, ensure it FAILS before implementation**

- [ ] T002 [US1] Create E2E test in `teacher-assistant/frontend/e2e-tests/library-modal-integration.spec.ts`
  - Test: "User Story 1: View image in library"
  - Generate image with REAL OpenAI call (NO bypass mode)
  - Save to library
  - Navigate to Library ‚Üí Materials tab
  - Click image thumbnail
  - Verify modal opens with full image
  - Verify metadata displays (title, date, type)
  - Verify close button works
  - Use `{ timeout: 60000 }` for generation steps
  - Test MUST fail initially (modal integration not implemented yet)

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [ ] T003 [US1] Modify Library component in `teacher-assistant/frontend/src/pages/Library/Library.tsx`
  - Import MaterialPreviewModal from `components/MaterialPreviewModal`
  - Import `convertArtifactToUnifiedMaterial` from `lib/materialMappers`
  - Add state: `const [selectedMaterial, setSelectedMaterial] = useState<UnifiedMaterial | null>(null)`
  - Add state: `const [isModalOpen, setIsModalOpen] = useState<boolean>(false)`
  - Create `handleMaterialClick` function that:
    - Converts ArtifactItem to UnifiedMaterial using mapper
    - Sets selectedMaterial state
    - Sets isModalOpen to true
  - Add onClick handler to material card div (around line 400)
  - Render MaterialPreviewModal at IonPage level (after IonContent, before closing IonPage tag)
  - Pass props: `material={selectedMaterial}`, `isOpen={isModalOpen}`, `onClose={handleClose}`
  - Create `handleClose` function that sets isModalOpen(false) and setSelectedMaterial(null)

- [ ] T004 [US1] Verify E2E test passes
  - Run: `VITE_TEST_MODE=true npx playwright test library-modal-integration.spec.ts --reporter=list`
  - Expected: Test "User Story 1: View image in library" passes
  - May take 45-60 seconds due to real OpenAI generation
  - Test MUST pass before moving to next task

**Checkpoint**: At this point, clicking image thumbnails should open full preview modal with all metadata. Test independently verified with E2E test.

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Regenerate Image with Original Parameters (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Teachers can click "Neu generieren" in the preview modal to create variations using the same original parameters

**Independent Test**: Teacher opens any saved image ‚Üí Clicks "Neu generieren" ‚Üí Agent form opens with all original parameters pre-filled (description, image style, learning group, subject).

### E2E Test for User Story 2 ‚úÖ MANDATORY

**NOTE: Write test FIRST, ensure it FAILS before implementation**

- [ ] T005 [US2] Add E2E test to `teacher-assistant/frontend/e2e-tests/library-modal-integration.spec.ts`
  - Test: "User Story 2: Regenerate image with original parameters"
  - Navigate to Library with existing image
  - Click image thumbnail to open modal
  - Click "Neu generieren" button
  - Verify agent form opens
  - Verify description field is pre-filled with original value
  - Verify imageStyle field is pre-filled
  - Modify description and generate new image (REAL OpenAI call)
  - Use `{ timeout: 60000 }` for generation
  - Test MUST initially show that regeneration button works (MaterialPreviewModal already has this logic)

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [ ] T006 [US2] Verify MaterialPreviewModal regeneration logic in `teacher-assistant/frontend/src/components/MaterialPreviewModal.tsx`
  - Confirm handleRegenerate function exists (lines 142-198)
  - Confirm it extracts originalParams from metadata
  - Confirm graceful degradation for missing metadata (FR-010)
  - Confirm backward compatibility with old structure (FR-011)
  - Confirm it calls `openModal('image-generation', originalParams)`
  - **This should already work** - just verify in code review

- [ ] T007 [US2] Verify metadata structure in Library integration
  - Check that Library.tsx passes complete material object to MaterialPreviewModal
  - Verify metadata field includes originalParams when available
  - Test with images that have old metadata structure
  - Test with images missing metadata entirely
  - Ensure no TypeScript errors or runtime crashes

- [ ] T008 [US2] Verify E2E test passes
  - Run: `VITE_TEST_MODE=true npx playwright test library-modal-integration.spec.ts --grep "User Story 2" --reporter=list`
  - Expected: Test "User Story 2: Regenerate image with original parameters" passes
  - May take 90-120 seconds due to two image generations
  - Test MUST pass before moving to next task

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work. Teachers can view images in library AND regenerate with original parameters. Both tested independently with E2E tests.

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Improve Agent Confirmation Button Visibility (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Agent confirmation button has high visibility with proper contrast and sizing to meet accessibility standards

**Independent Test**: Teacher types "Erstelle ein Bild von einem L√∂wen" ‚Üí Agent suggestion appears ‚Üí Confirmation button is clearly visible and styled distinctively.

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [ ] T009 [P] [US3] Modify AgentConfirmationMessage button styles in `teacher-assistant/frontend/src/components/AgentConfirmationMessage.tsx`
  - Locate button at line 278 (className starting with "flex-1 h-12 bg-primary-500...")
  - Change height from `h-12` to `h-14` (56px - exceeds 44px minimum touch target)
  - Change font-weight from `font-medium` to `font-semibold`
  - Add text size: `text-base` (if not already present)
  - Add shadow: `shadow-md hover:shadow-lg`
  - Add transitions: `transition-all duration-200`
  - Verify WCAG AA contrast ratio (primary-500 orange vs white = ~8:1, exceeds 4.5:1 requirement)
  - Keep existing ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

- [ ] T010 [US3] Manual test button visibility
  - Test on Desktop Chrome: Type chat message that triggers agent
  - Verify button is highly visible and stands out from background
  - Test on Mobile Safari (375x667 iPhone SE)
  - Verify touch target is ‚â•44x44px (use browser dev tools to measure)
  - Test with screen reader (optional but recommended)
  - Document in session log with screenshots

**Checkpoint**: Agent confirmation button now meets accessibility standards and is highly visible. Can be tested independently by triggering any agent.

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Improve Loading View Design (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Loading view shows clean, non-redundant message that matches the app's design language

**Independent Test**: Teacher starts image generation ‚Üí Loading view appears with clean, non-redundant text that matches the app's design language.

### Implementation for User Story 4

- [x] T011 [P] [US4] Modify loading view in `teacher-assistant/frontend/src/components/AgentProgressView.tsx`
  - Locate loading state JSX (search for "In Bearbeitung" or similar loading text)
  - Remove redundant text (both "Bild erstellen" header and "In Bearbeitung..." message)
  - Replace with single, clean message structure:
    - Spinner: `className="inline-block animate-spin rounded-full h-12 w-12 border-4 border-primary-500 border-t-transparent"`
    - Main message: `className="mt-4 text-lg font-medium text-gray-700"` ‚Üí "Dein Bild wird erstellt..."
    - Sub-message: `className="mt-2 text-sm text-gray-500"` ‚Üí "Das kann bis zu 1 Minute dauern"
  - Ensure design matches Tailwind config (use existing color/typography classes)
  - Add progress feedback for operations >10 seconds if not already present (FR-017)

- [ ] T012 [US4] Manual test loading view design
  - Start image generation process
  - Verify loading view shows single, clear message (no redundancy)
  - Verify design matches app's overall visual language
  - Test that message remains visible for full duration (30-60 seconds)
  - Document in session log with screenshot

**Checkpoint**: Loading view design is clean and consistent. Can be tested independently by starting any image generation.

---

## Phase 7: User Story 5 - Improve Result View Design (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Result view layout follows the app's design system with consistent spacing and button styles

**Independent Test**: Teacher completes image generation ‚Üí Result view appears with layout matching the app's design system and clear action buttons.

### Implementation for User Story 5

- [x] T013 [P] [US5] Modify result view layout in `teacher-assistant/frontend/src/components/AgentResultView.tsx`
  - Locate action buttons section (search for "In Library speichern" or similar buttons)
  - Update button container from `gap-2` to `gap-4`
  - Add responsive flex direction: `flex-col sm:flex-row` (stack on mobile, row on desktop)
  - Update primary button (Library speichern):
    - `className="flex-1 bg-primary-500 hover:bg-primary-600 text-white font-medium py-3 px-6 rounded-lg transition-colors"`
  - Update secondary button (Weiter im Chat):
    - `className="flex-1 bg-gray-100 hover:bg-gray-200 text-gray-700 font-medium py-3 px-6 rounded-lg transition-colors"`
  - Verify image preview has proper sizing: `max-w-2xl` class
  - Ensure layout follows Tailwind spacing scale (FR-018)

- [ ] T014 [US5] Manual test result view design
  - Complete image generation to see result view
  - Verify layout matches design system (spacing, typography, colors)
  - Verify image preview is clearly visible and properly sized
  - Test on both Desktop Chrome and Mobile Safari
  - Verify buttons are clearly labeled and follow app's button patterns
  - Document in session log with screenshot

**Checkpoint**: All user stories now complete. Result view design is consistent with app design system.

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - T001 can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: SKIPPED - all infrastructure already exists
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All user stories depend on T001 (type mapper utility)
  - US1 (Phase 3): Depends on T001
  - US2 (Phase 4): Depends on T001, T003 (US1 implementation)
  - US3 (Phase 5): Independent - can run in parallel with US1/US2
  - US4 (Phase 6): Independent - can run in parallel with US1/US2/US3
  - US5 (Phase 7): Independent - can run in parallel with US1/US2/US3/US4
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Depends on T001 (type mapper) - Critical for MVP
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Depends on T001, T003 (US1 modal integration) - Critical for MVP
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Independent - can start anytime after T001
- **User Story 4 (P3)**: Independent - can start anytime
- **User Story 5 (P3)**: Independent - can start anytime

### Within Each User Story

- **E2E tests written FIRST** - must fail before implementation
- **Implementation SECOND** - make tests pass
- **Verification THIRD** - confirm tests pass before moving on

### Parallel Opportunities

- **After T001 completes**, all of these can run in parallel:
  - T002 (US1 E2E test)
  - T009 (US3 button visibility)
  - T011 (US4 loading view)
  - T013 (US5 result view)
- **User Stories 3, 4, 5 are completely independent** - can be implemented by different developers simultaneously

---

## Parallel Example: After Type Mapper Ready

```bash
# After T001 completes, launch these tasks in parallel:

# Developer 1: US1 - Library Modal Integration
Task: "T002 - Create E2E test for User Story 1"
Task: "T003 - Modify Library.tsx for modal integration"

# Developer 2: US3 - Button Visibility (independent)
Task: "T009 - Modify AgentConfirmationMessage button styles"

# Developer 3: US4 & US5 - Design Polish (independent)
Task: "T011 - Modify loading view in AgentFormView"
Task: "T013 - Modify result view layout in AgentResultView"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1-2 Only - P1 Critical)

1. **Complete Phase 1**: Setup (T001 - type mapper utility)
2. **Complete Phase 3**: User Story 1 (T002-T004 - view images in library)
3. **Complete Phase 4**: User Story 2 (T005-T008 - regenerate with original params)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Run E2E tests for US1 + US2, manual test on both platforms
5. **Deploy/demo if ready** - Critical bugs (BUG-020, BUG-019) are now fixed

### Incremental Delivery (Add Design Improvements)

1. **MVP deployed** ‚Üí Foundation working
2. **Add User Story 3** (T009-T010) ‚Üí Improve button visibility ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy
3. **Add User Story 4** (T011-T012) ‚Üí Improve loading design ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy
4. **Add User Story 5** (T013-T014) ‚Üí Improve result design ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. **T001 (type mapper)** - Single developer completes first
2. **Once T001 done**:
   - Developer A: User Stories 1-2 (P1 critical - sequential)
   - Developer B: User Story 3 (P2 - parallel)
   - Developer C: User Stories 4-5 (P3 - parallel)
3. All stories integrate independently without conflicts

## Notes

- **[P] tasks** = different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- **[Story] label** maps task to specific user story for traceability (US1, US2, US3, US4, US5)
- **E2E tests are MANDATORY** per user feedback - NO bypass mode, real OpenAI calls, proper timeouts
- **Test duration is NOT a reason to skip testing** - expect 45-90 seconds per test
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify E2E tests fail before implementing, then pass after implementation
- Commit after each user story or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- User Stories 1-2 are P1 (critical) - these fix BUG-020 and BUG-019
- User Stories 3-5 are P2-P3 (design improvements) - can be deferred if needed

**Critical Testing Reminder** (from user feedback):
- All tests MUST use real user interactions (NO bypass mode)
- Test duration is NOT a valid reason to skip testing
- All errors must be caught BEFORE marking task complete
- Use `{ timeout: 60000 }` for image generation steps
- Document all test results in session log with screenshots
