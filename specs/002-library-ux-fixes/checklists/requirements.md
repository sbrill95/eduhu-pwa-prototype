# Specification Quality Checklist: Library UX Fixes

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-12
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Validation Notes**:
- ✅ Spec avoids implementation details (no mention of React, TypeScript, specific file names)
- ✅ User stories focus on teacher workflows and value delivery
- ✅ Language is accessible to non-technical readers
- ✅ All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Scope) present and complete

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Validation Notes**:
- ✅ Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers in spec
- ✅ All FRs use actionable language (MUST display, MUST maintain, MUST handle)
- ✅ Success criteria include specific metrics (100% success rate, under 10 seconds, 95% discovery, under 2 seconds)
- ✅ Success criteria are user-focused (no mention of frameworks, databases, or implementation)
- ✅ Each user story has 3-4 clear acceptance scenarios with Given/When/Then format
- ✅ 5 edge cases documented (expired URLs, null metadata, multiple modals, small screens, timeout)
- ✅ Scope section clearly defines in/out of scope
- ✅ 4 dependencies and 6 assumptions documented

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Validation Notes**:
- ✅ Each FR maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- ✅ 5 user stories cover all primary flows (view, regenerate, button visibility, design improvements)
- ✅ User stories prioritized (P1 for critical, P2 for UX, P3 for cosmetic)
- ✅ Specification remains technology-agnostic throughout

## Final Assessment

**Status**: ✅ **PASSED - READY FOR PLANNING**

**Overall Quality**: Excellent

**Strengths**:
1. Clear prioritization helps identify MVP (User Stories 1-2 are P1 blockers)
2. Comprehensive edge case coverage
3. Measurable success criteria enable clear verification
4. Well-documented dependencies and constraints

**Recommendations for Planning**:
- Focus implementation on P1 stories first (Library Modal + Regeneration)
- P2-P3 stories can be implemented in parallel or deferred
- Consider creating separate E2E tests for each user story given independent testability

**Next Steps**: Ready for `/speckit.plan`
