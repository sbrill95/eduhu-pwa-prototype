## When to Use

### Full PRD (`*create-brownfield-prd`)

### Epic Only (`*create-brownfield-epic`)
- Enhancement is well-defined and isolated
- Existing documentation is comprehensive
- Changes don't impact multiple systems
- Quick turnaround needed

### Story Only (`*create-brownfield-story`)
- Bug fixes
- Tiny features
- No architectural impact
- Clear implementation path

## Brownfield Focus

When working with existing projects:
1. **Analyze existing documentation** first
2. **Request specific enhancement details** from user
3. **Assess complexity** and recommend approach
4. **Create epic/story structure** for the enhancement
5. **Identify risks and integration points**
6. **Respect existing patterns** and constraints

## Output Locations
